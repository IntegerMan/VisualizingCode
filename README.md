# VisualizingCode
Analysis resources for my [Visualizing Code](https://www.codemash.org/session-details/?id=281598) talk

The bulk of the visualizations are in `Analysis.ipynb` which is built as a self-guided tour of the data visualization process. Additional notebooks and python files can be found in the `FileStatisticsMiner` folder and illustrate how to go about pulling some of the data required for the main notebook.

If you haven't worked with a Jupyter notebook before, check out [my article on Anaconda](https://accessibleai.dev/post/anaconda/) as a quick tutorial on my recommended way of setting up an environment with Python and Jupyter notebooks. 

You can run that notebook directly in the web browser or you can use VS Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension (or another IDE supporting Jupyter notebooks) to get started. VS Code should recommend that you install those extensions if you open this folder in VS Code.
